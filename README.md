# TS-Visualizer

TS-Visualizer is a web-only, local-only implementation of AST parser and visualizer. Feel free to give it a try at [the official Github page](https://intmainreturn0.com/ts-visualizer/).

Internally, it parses the source code entirely in browser thanks to [Tree-Sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/)'s WASM support. It uses [tree-sitter-langs](https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs/tree/master/repos)'s compilation of language parsers.

Any contribution will be highly welcomed. Since this is a hobby project, the code is unpolished, and support will be on best-effort basis.
